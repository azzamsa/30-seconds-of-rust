# Development Guide

## Adding New Snippet

Use the [previous](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/tree/e6064b1236bbe64f0a7f4e1127223b75848b92e8/) version of the repository.
It is more readable and easier to find things.

Many of the snippets are one-liners.
Use [Iterator in std::iter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) documentation to find suitable function.
